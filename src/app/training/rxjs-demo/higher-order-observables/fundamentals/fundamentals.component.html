  <h1>What're Operators</h1>

      <h2>
        Operators are functions. Operators are the essential pieces that allow
        complex asynchronous code to be easily composed in a declarative manner.

  <h1>What're Higher-order Observables</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2>
        Observables most commonly emit ordinary values like strings and numbers,
        but surprisingly often, it is necessary to handle Observables of
        Observables, so-called higher-order Observables.
